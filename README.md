## 🚀 Project Vision

EXOCORTEX aims to build a **low-cost, non-invasive brain–computer interface** that maps cognitive intent and emotional state into **real-time robotic movement**. This system is intended to serve as an assistive arm for differently-abled individuals — blending **neural control**, **affective AI**, and **human–machine symbiosis**.
